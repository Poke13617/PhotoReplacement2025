What this project covers:
This website covers the following
- 3ds modding
- wii/Vwii modding

DISCLOSER: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY BROKEN CONSOLES. FOLLOW WHAT THE WEBSITE THAT ACTUALLY KNOWS THIS STUFF SAYS!

Key terms to know (3DS):


site for 3ds - 3ds.hacks.guide (Found off the official homebrew discord server)

U^2 - Universal Updater Abbreviation

CFW - Custom Firmware 

Homebrew - Custom applications/firmware/modifications

Luma3ds - New Hardware that replaces the 3ds menu. This firmware boots on startup and looks/acts identical to the original 3ds menu.

hshop - custom app (I can not disclose what this is under nintendo copyright laws against piracy.)

Old 3ds family, every console that doesn't have the term "New" on it

Root of an sd card - where the sd card always starts at

System Version - this is found by heading to settings on the console and checking bottom left of the top screen. This effects how you mod the console

ntrboot - alternate method to modding 3ds family consoles - requires ds flashcart (cartridge with an sdxhc card)

---This is the end of the 3DS section. Next section is the Wii/VWii key terms---

Vwii - Virtual Wii (eg; Dolphin emulator on github)

Fat32 - SD card type

LetterBomb - SD card file used to open up the Wii/VWii. This requires a game to function as you (Likely) need a game to start a save file. This is important to complete a required step.

________ Channel - Applications on the Wii used for certain application addons

Game requirements - Some specific actions (Such as LetterBomb) cannot occur without a certain game (I used smash brothers brawl for mine, but there are some other games)

Wii-Link - External app to perform functions not found by current/non-modded channels. This adds functional channels to the Wii Home Menu to help with reason to download it.

Nintendon't - Gamecube Rom Loader



-------Common errors (3DS)---------

-There is a chance to BRICK YOUR CONSOLE. This makes the console UNUSABLE, mod at your own risk?

-That was the only one I know of...




-------Common questions/problems-------

Q:What will I need to mod my Wii/3DS?

A:You will need:
                 A 8-32GB SDXHC/SD Card (Depends on which console/model you are doing.)
                 A console to run it on
                 A laptop/pc
                 An sd card reader (If your PC/Laptop doesn't have one that supports the size card)
                 A stable internet connection
                 Access to the website/discord server
                 The ability to access everything (And I mean EVERYTHING DATA-WISE) That is on the console
                 A few hour (Because I can tell you haven't modded a console before) (20-40 minutes - average 3DS Modding ETA) ( 2-8 hours - average Wii/VWii modding ETA)

Q: What will this allow me to do on 3DS that I can't do already?

A: This will allow you to;
   - - - Run homebrew apps (From Universal updater or from external app)
   - - - Mod 3DS Save Files/Apps
   - - - Unlock new apps to use (U^2, CIA, Homebrew Channel, etc)
   - - - Download 3DS Games and DLC (Found in the hshop)
   - - - Unlock Online Multiplayer for certain games (MK7, Smash Brothers, etc)


Q: What will this allow me to do on 3DS that I can't do already?

A: This will allow you to;
   - - - Run homebrew apps (From built in addon)
   - - - Download Wii Games (External (⚠️CAUTION: CAN CONTAIN MULTIPLE VIRUSES! KNOW YOUR DOWNLOAD SOURCE!!))
   - - - Unlock new apps/games to use (through downloader, they cover this in the )

Q: What is your favorite part about the 3ds/Wii modding process?

A: For 3DS, that would have to be the open-endedness of the games that you can get. For Wii, it would have to be how it allows you to get Wiiware on the console easily as pokemon rumble was one of my favorite games for the Wii.

Q: What would be the risks if I use an incompatible item to this process (such as an sd card over 32gb)?

A: The risks would most likely be that It will either take longer as you would have to learn from somewhere else on how to format the card to be the correct size. This shouldn't brick your console.

Q: What wii consoles can I mod with wii.hacks.guide?

A:Wii/WiiU/Wii Mini

Q:What 3DS Console can I mod with 3ds.hacks.guide?

A:3ds/2ds/3dsXL/N3ds/N2dsXL/N3dsXL (N stands for New family, which require a different exploit)

wii.hacks.guide is the website that walks through how to mod a wii (Also on the homebrew discord)
wii link is an external service that requires a fully modded wii before (You NEED it modded before, and this will require some important information, nothing like a SSN or anything)
