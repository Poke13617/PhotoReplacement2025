DISCLOSER: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY BROKEN CONSOLES. FOLLOW WHAT THE WEBSITE THAT ACTUALLY KNOWS THIS STUFF SAYS!

Key terms to know:
Vwii - Virtual Wii (eg; Dolphin emulator on github)

site for 3ds - 3ds.hacks.guide (Found off the official homebrew discord server)

CFW - Custom Firmware 

Homebrew - Custom applications/firmware/modifications

Luma3ds - New Hardware that replaces the 3ds menu. This firmware boots on startup and looks/acts identical to the original 3ds menu.

Old 3ds family, every console that doesn't have the term "New" on it

Root of an sd card - where the sd card always starts at

System Version - this is found by heading to settings on the console and checking bottom left of the top screen. This effects how you mod the console
