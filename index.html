<h4>What does it mean to "Mod a console"?</h4>
<br>
<p>To mod a console is to change the consoles code so it does play certain games that people want it to play, whether that be online mario kart, download new games off sketchy (or not so sketchy) sites (I don't endorse Piracy. To quote Joey Perleoni, "Piracy is No Party"), or to get more interactivity to the console. Modding has it all!</p>

    <h4>What is required to mod one of these consoles?</h4>
    <p>To mod one of the consoles, you will need a 32GB SD Card (Type varies between console), a way to read an sd card (of any size), the console, and a PC, laptop, or any way to download the files needed.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h4>How would I find these websites?</h4>
    <br><br>
    <p>For the official sites (my favorites), go to <a href="https://wii.hacks.guide">This for the official Wii™ modding site</a> or <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide">This for the 3ds™ modding site.</a></p>
    <br><p>You can also go to <a href="3ds.html">my 3DS™ site</a> and <a href="wii.html">my Wii™ site</a>.</p>

        <h2>What does it mean to mod a nintendo Wii?</h2><br>
        <p>To mod a nintendo Wii™, you likely need to learn some basic terms similar to the 3ds™ reasoning. There will be other terms that are very important to know. Some of these very important terms to know for this modding process includes the terms FAT32, Channels, External downloads, IP address, letterbombs, and last of all, the homebrew channel.</p>
