      <div class="row row-cols-3">
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 cinzel card1">Welcome to the 3DS Modding section of this site</div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 cinzel card2">There are a lot of things to cover (and a lot more than I can fit here)</div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 cinzel card3">Here is a list of some terms to know</div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 cinzel card4">GodMod9 - Hacking tool to add certain files and make the console less likely to brick<br><br>
        Superskaterhax - Hacking tool used with the SD Card to start this program</div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 cinzel card5">SDXHC - SD Card used with "New" 3DS Family Consoles<br><br>
        Luma3DS - Custom 3DS Hardware, used as the default loading screen after modding the console</div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 cinzel card6">FAT32 - Type of SD card type it has to end up as before anything can happen.<br><br>
        Homebrew - CFW (Custom Firmware) that changes how a console functions when activated. </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container text-center">
      <div class="row row-cols-2">
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 lt3ds">Step 1 is to make sure you don't already have the CFW installed on the console. This can be used by inputting (While the console is off) [select(hold) -> power]. If the original loading screen shows up, that means that the CFW is not on the console. That means you should proceed to step 2. If the screen does show up, it's already modded and doesn't need to, you could proceed to <a href="#hshop"><b>The Hshop</b></a> to install the only other app I cover.</div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 rt3ds">Step 2 is to check the system version. To find the system version, head to the system settings app, when you get in to the app, the version appears on the bottom-left of the top screen. This is very important for later.</div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 lt3ds">Step 3 is to know which model you have. The old 3ds console consist of the 3ds, 3dsXL, and 2ds, the 3ds has less rounded corners when comparing it to the new 3ds. The other different is the right stick only exists on the new 3ds family consoles. You also need the system version (Explained above) You can head to <a href="3dsnew.html"><b>This site</b></a> To learn more on the new family 3ds consoles.
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 rt3ds">Step 4 - Know your OS for the device you are using whilst modding. I'll be explaining as if I was using a chromebook (I did this on my modding process)
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 lt3ds">Step 5 - Download MSET9 Installer and ZArchiver. These will be used to add the files needed. I won't go into detail, but this is for an old 3ds hardware 11-17-0-U-50</div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 rt3ds">Step 6 - Delete all mii maker data and reopen the app. This should allow it to load on the 3ds. The next thing is to go to the extra data. If It is successful, you will load into SafeB9Installer</div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 lt3ds">Step 7 - You next have to follow the prompts given to install boot9strap. After completing, you remove MSET9 from the SD Card through the installer application.</div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 rt3ds">Step 8 - Download hshop on <a href="hshop.erista.me" id="hshop"><b>THIS WEBSITE (THE OFFICIAL HSHOP WEBSITE)</b></a></div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 max3ds">Step 9 - Enjoy your newly modded 3ds!</div>

      <div class="col-6 col-md-4 card1">This is a very obvious fact: I and the others who are willing to help people mod nintendo consoles are NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR MISTAKES, MOD AT YOUR OWN RISK.</div>
      <div class="col-6 col-md-4 card3">Another fact: This CAN brick your 3DS family console, making it UNUSABLE. Follow the steps very closely, and don't do anything incorrectly as the chance may not be 99%, but still there.</div>
      <div class="col-6 col-md-4 card5">Last Fact: This process takes 30-60 minutes if following carefully, so make sure you follow carefully instead of rushing. It's worth it to slow down.</div>
