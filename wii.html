    <h1>Nintendo Wii™ Modding</h1>
    <br><br><br>
    <h2>What does it mean to mod a Wii?</h2><br>
    <p>To mod a wii, you need similar stuff to what was listed on the last page. The best way to do this would be to buy a copy of Lego Indiana Jones, Lego Batman, Lego Star Wars, The Complete Saga, or you could get Mario Kart Wii or Smash Bros Brawl if you're intending on keeping the game. </p>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <h2>Quick rundown: How do you mod a wii the fastest?</h2>
    <br>
    <h5>Step One</h5><br>
    <p>Step one is to commit a letterbomb, there are 9 different games to complete this easily.</p>
    <ul>
    <table class="tbl1">
        <thead>
            <tr>
            <th>Game name</th>
            <th>How to complete</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
            <td>Smash Stack - Super Smash bros. Brawl</td>
            <td>This is the first of 9 legacy versions that work. This loads directly from files on the SD card using the game's map maker mode. After downloading the needed files to start the process, make sure to make a map to add to the SD card to add the file to.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Twilight Hack - The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</td>
                <td>To use this hack. You have to use the SD card to find the save file for this game. You delete the official save data and swap this with the .elf file that is compatible with the region youu are using. The modding process is found with the inner circle text. After this and some other steps, you delete your game's save data, if you are using System Menu 3.4, you are on a time crunch, you have to rush this, then talk to the man standing in front of you.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Indiana pwns - LEGO Indiana Jones</td>
                <td>This hack is actually a lot of code stolen from the Twilight Hack. This requires a game data save of this. In Barnett College, where you end up. Walk to the art room throught the courtyard and approach the left character. When it zooms on him, choose the "switch to" option.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Bathaxx - LEGO Batman</td>
                <td>This is similar to the last 2. To activate after finding the .elf or .dool file, insert them to the SD Card, This apparently uses the trophy room, located by the elevator on the right side of the batcave. You end up needing to go to the upper left corner of the trophy room to enter "Wayne Manor". When prompted to select a character. Choose the last enabled one in the lowest row.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Return of the Jodi - Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga</td>
                <td>This requires a save at all. Change the name of the save data to something else. This is actually found in a bar on the right of the lobby of the game. The hack (Like the other LEGO™ Games) turns the hack into a mystery character that doesn't show up.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Eri HaKawai - Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World</td>
                <td>I don't know much about this one as I haven't even heard of this game. But I can tell this is another mod that requires a save data. This creates another entity in the game, this time a monster. Named either the hack's name or "Giantpune"/</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Yu-Gi-OWNED! - Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's Wheelie Breakers</td>
                <td>This requires a PAL version of this game. When starting the game, press A and wait until the title menu shows up. This doesn't require any extra, just press the prompt to get into the loading screen.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Yu-Gi-Vah - Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's Wheelie Breakers</td>
                <td>This is for the North American or Japanese Wii consoles. This uses an almost identical process to the PAL version of this game.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>szsHaxx (Normal Wii Only) - Mario Kart Wii</td>
                <td>This actually is used with 2GB or less size cards. This hack actually overflows the competition data output buffer, this allows for the arbitrary code to be running. This one doesn't even enable hardware modifications but does enable homebrew.</td>
            </tr>
