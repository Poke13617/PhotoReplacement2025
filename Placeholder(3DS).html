    <h1>3DS Modding</h1>
    <br><br>
    <h3>What is 3ds modding?</h3><br>
    <p>3ds modding is the process of making the 3ds behave differently than what the people intended for it to do. This opens up a world of possibilities for other mods. The steps are simple, but if you don't know what most of these terms mean, you'll be lost, causing it to take around an hour of your time</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Quick rundown: How to mod a 3DS Family Console the fastest:</h2>
    <h3>Steps to do</h3>
    <h4>Step 1: DISCLAIMER</h4>
    <p>Step 1 This is to take this very obvious fact: I and the others who are willing to help people mod nintendo consoles are NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR MISTAKES, MOD AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
    <h4>Step 2: Guide Explanation</h4>
    <p>
    - What this guide covers includes <br>
    - Installing boot9strap and Luma3DS custom firmware on unmodified 3DS family consoles<br>
    - Install various pieces of homebrew software, such as a package installer, save file manager, and a homebrew app store<br>
    - Make critical system file backups to help work around bricks (and recover data when one happens</p>
    <h4>Step 3: Important facts</h4>

            What does it mean to go to the "root of SD" or the "/luma/" folders?

            To go to the root of your SD card means that you have to go to the far back of the SD card.

          <div class="accordion-body">
            The size of the SD card would depend on the model of console. A "New" series console can run at max a 32GB SDXHC card. An older 3DS card uses a 32GB SD Card (Larger one. There are containers that you can buy at walmart for around $12 that come with 2 SDXHC cards and a SDXHC to SD card reader.)

          <div class="accordion-body">
            A modded 3DS for starters can run extra or different files than a non-modded 3DS, that can't run any files that are not game save data or officially added to the SD card through legal means. Another difference is that modded consoles have the capability to bring back online play to games that were shut down, while non-modded consoles lost all online support almost 2 years ago. The last difference is the performance statistics. The modded consoles can run games with better statistics and with other add-ons while non-modded 3DS consoles can't even run their own games at decent statistics.
